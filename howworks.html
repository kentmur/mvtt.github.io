            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
              Every week throughout winter, a different short (5-8km) course is
              selected and
              <a href="schedule.html">posted and described here</a>. Racers can
              start any time between 9am and 10am, either by themselves or with
              people they would like to race with or chase. Each week's race
              will have a specific start and finish location identified on the
              schedule page. Its up to each individual to time themselves using
              their own watches or phones at the specific start and finish
              lines. Afterwards they report their time to
              <a href="mailto:kentm1961@hotmail.com?subject=MVTT results:"
                >MVTT Results</a
              >
              for tracking results. The courses vary among many different
              options the Methow has to offer, and technique alternates between
              Skate and Classic.
