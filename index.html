            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The Methow Valley Time Trial Series runs every week throughout
              winter on Friday mornings. Races are held on various
              <a href="schedule.html"> short (5-8km) courses</a> throughout the
              valley. Some courses are flatter, some rolling and there will be
              one hill climb towards the end of the season. Technique alternates
              between skate and classic each week. Races are self-timed. There
              is no registration, fees or bibs. Just skiers getting together for
              some active fun, within a great communinity. The goal is to offer
              something for everyone - an easy way for any skiers wishing to
              work some variation and intensity into their fitness routines or
              experiment with some light competition. Its also a good way for
              avid racers to add some additional race training to their
              schedules without heavy impact.
